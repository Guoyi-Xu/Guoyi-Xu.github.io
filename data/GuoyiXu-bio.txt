Guoyi Xu joined CoSMIC Lab as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in September 2023. He received his Bachelor of Engineering degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2023. His research interests include joint communication and sensing, digital signal processing for massive MIMO, radio-frequency/mm-Wave systems, indoor wireless sensing (detection and localization), and radio-frequency identification (RFID). His Ph.D. dissertation focused on developing radio-frequency systems and signal processing techniques for indoor sensing and localization. His papers were the finalist for Best Paper Award in IEEE RFID 2023 – the 17 th International Conference on RFID and the Student Paper Contest of the 2024 IEEE Topical Conference on Wireless Sensors and Sensor Networks (WiSNet). In Spring 2022, he worked at MathWorks Inc. as a graduate student intern where he developed new features for HDL Verifier’s Cosimulation between HDL simulators and MATLAB/Simulink.
